$_WHY_145_PM_$ :-----------------------------------------------:

    Hypothesis : Most people will round their video
               : publishing to 1 hour incriments. So
               : To avoid less competition we must
               : publish at one of the non-even intervals.
               :
               : Path of least resistance dictates most
               : people thinking ahead like this will
               : pick "1:15" , so we should pick "1:45".
               :
               : Assuming youtube doesn't F_U_C_K us because
               : we have deviated from the norm, this should
               : be a benificial strategy.
               :
               : There is however the possibility that
               : youtube HAS or WILL create a bug that
               : only promotes my video in the time range :
               :
               : 1:45PM to 2:00PM , rather than the full
               : 1:45PM to 2:45PM time range.
               :
               : I wouldn't trust them NOT TO MAKE THIS BUG.
               : For god sakes, when you select videos with
               : their UI, the list of videos always has
               : the last video selected out of order!
