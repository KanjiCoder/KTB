I accidentially forgot to delete these out takes and committed
them to the repo. FUCKING HELL. I am not doing whatever
time-wasting black-magic is required to purge this data
from the version control.

Simply deleting these videos would be a waste because then
we will just have 30MB of data sitting there doing 
absolutely nothing.

I am very angry at myself right now.
